# Childline - Report explicit online content

A web app for reporting explicit online images to the IWF (internet watch foundation).

## Development Resources & Notes

### Websites

- [Childline website](https://www.childline.org.uk/info-advice/bullying-abuse-safety/online-mobile-safety/sexting/) - Use for colour schemes as it is already 'proven for use case'.
  * Colours: 
```css
  #00a1d0 
  #73cfe8
  #234f62
  #632c7a
  #eb5857
```
- [IWF online form](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) - This form takes a minimum of 5 interactions with Childline website. It is very difficult to find...

### Libraries

- [animate css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) - include *simple* animations for smooth page transitions, however keeping it basic to ensure the user feels taken seriously.
- [materialize css](http://materializecss.com/buttons.html) - css library for key components.

### Prototype tech stack

- Node Hapi.js server
- client side rendering
